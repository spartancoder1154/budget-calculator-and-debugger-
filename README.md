This Python script is an interactive **monthly budget calculator** that helps users track their income and expenses. It prompts the user to enter their total income, fixed expenses (like rent and utilities), and a list of variable expenses through a loop. After collecting the data, the script calculates the total monthly expenses and remaining budget, then displays a detailed summary. Built-in checks and error handling ensure that the inputs are valid numeric values, and conditional messages offer feedback on the user's financial standingâ€”whether they're saving, breaking even, or overspending. Debug statements are included to assist with transparency and troubleshooting during the budgeting process.
